# QDSyntheticData

This repository serves as the main organizational tool for the [survey paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tvvwqwxmqdvf#e3f33) "A Survey of Methods for Generating Quality and Diverse Synthetic Data with LLMs". We are collecting papers in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rJuiM-553zsryF5HHWEL0Z7ucPaXSA_x6U9tQo-yaPE/edit?usp=sharing). You can find a roadmap for the project on [this](https://github.com/users/Dahoas/projects/7/views/1) Github projects board. The board also contains a (tentative) timeline for the project.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to catalog the many current ad hoc methods for synthetic data generation via LLMs with a focus on understanding their impact on two metrics: dataset quality and dataset diversity. An important sub-question we will need to discuss is how to appropriately define these metrics, in particular dataset diversity. 

Overall, Tthis will roughly consist of three stages:
1. **Collection**: finding as many papers as we can pertaining to synthetic data generation and measures of and techniques improving quality or diversity for LLMs.
2. **Synthesis**: writing a survey of our findings by organizing methods into a single conceptual framework. We may also want to do some benchmarking.
3. **Next steps**: identifying promising research directions as recommendations to the broader community
